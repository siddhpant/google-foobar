# What is foobar? Is this some example repo?

Google foobar is a challenge held by Google, which is not accessible generally. You have to either get invited to it by a referral of someone who's already in the system, or Google selects you and invites you when you are browsing Google and its related sites. It consists of a variety of challenges, with 5 levels. The latter levels are *strongly* inclined towards mathematics and algorithms. Foobar has been in the news as a secret hiring program run by Google, but it would be best that you treat it as a set of challenges to complete, and learn many things along the way. The hiring part is a lucky bonus, but it's certainly not guarenteed. ~~lmao retard you won't get into Google with this, let go of the stupid wet dream.~~ All in all, it was a good learning oppurtunity.

## Did Google hire you?

Bruh moment. No, and I don't think just with this they will hire me. ~~I knew you'd ask this because the above paragraph is too long.~~

## Is this cheating?

No, since there are multiple solutions already out there on the internet which are accessible by a simple Google search.

## Oh, so you cheated! Hahaha you loser

No. You can see the original code and the approach in the comments (except the first two challs where I didn't write any comments, but the code should be obvious so the need for comments can be discounted).

There's no point in copy-pasting, it's in YOUR OWN good to solve yourselves and learn. Though, taking inspirations is fine.

I didn't save the questions for first few challenges, so I had to look them up, only to find availability of solutions (interestingly, solutions were far more easily found than the questions itself). So if you find no/differently styled test cases or difference in function name, that means I had to search that on internet. And anyways you might have stumbled across this while googling your problems / questions / algorithms / approaches too.
